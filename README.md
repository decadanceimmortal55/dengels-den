# dengels-den 
DENGEL'S DEN is a blog site of mine featuring coding projects from Girls Who Code and outside of Girls Who Code going forward, along woth my own ambitions for the future and welcome to anyone who wants to chat or form topics on a forum part of the website that will be coming soon.

During the duration of the website, I am aiming to improve my art and animation skills in order to major or minor anywhere in the art field and hopefully start a company producing animated shorts and movies, so I will keep posting art/animations of mine on the front page.
